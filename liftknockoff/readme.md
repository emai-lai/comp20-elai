This code successfully uses the Google Maps API to mark the userâ€™s current location as well as the locations of passengers or vehicles (and weinermobiles) from the response data of the ride request API. Unique info windows correctly display important distances relative to the marker that is clicked on.

I did not receive any help from my classmates other than from Piazza posts, and I spent about 20 hours on this assignment.

# responsive

This assignment contains a responsive.css file with a list of class rules for "homer" depending on the size of the browser screen. Different screen widths display different parts of the original homer image. I worked on this assignment alone and used the link resources provided. The project itself took about an hour to complete, but it took an additional two hours to figure out how to set up my SSH key and submit properly!

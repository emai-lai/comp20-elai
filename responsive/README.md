# responsive

This assignment includes a responsive.css file that contains a list of class rules for the "homer" depending on the size of the screen. Different screen widths display different parts of the home image. I worked on this assignment alone. The project itself took about an hour to complete, but it took an additional two hours to figure out how to set up my SSH key and submit properly!

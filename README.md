# comp20-elai

1. This Git repository allows me to manage my assignment files for COMP 20 and share them with my professor/TAs.
2. I liked lab 5 in which we created lyric captions for the Union Strike Folk Song. I’m a big fan of projects involving video/audio, and it was cool to get experience using the DOM and event handling in JavaScript. 
3. Coming into COMP-20, I had almost zero experience with web programming. Although I’m more specifically interested in front-end, I think it’s super useful and important to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, JS, and how the web generally works. The skills I’ve learned in this class will definitely carry into my future projects and endeavors. 
4. I learned that programming and designing for the web is not as impossibly hard as it seems. I used to think that web processes were magically unfathomable, and that I’d need years of experience to make my own website. In our first assignment however, I got to make my very own web portfolio complete with a photo, a resume, and CSS styling! Early on in this course I also learned about the developer tools tab on my web browser, which allowed to me to see some of the behind-the-scenes variables, responses, HTML, and the console associated with a web page.
5. I want to delve deeper into frameworks. We talked about using some frameworks like JQuery and Express, but I’m interested in exploring additional ones to serve as helpful templates and development guidelines for future projects.
